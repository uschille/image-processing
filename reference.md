{:auto\_ids}

adaptive thresholding
:   thresholding that uses a cut-off value that varies for pixels in different regions of the image.

additive colour model
:   a colour model that predicts the appearance of colours by summing the numeric representations of the component colours.

bacterial colony
:   a visible cluster of bacteria growing on the surface of or within a solid medium, presumably cultured from a single cell.

binary image
:   an image of pixels with only two possible values, 0 and 1. Typically, the two colours used for a binary image are black and white.

[bit](https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#bit)
:   a unit of information representing alternatives, yes/no, true/false. In computing a state of either 0 or 1.

blur
:   the averaging of pixel intensities within a neighbourhood. This has the effect of "softening" the features of the image, reducing noise and finer detail.

BMP (bitmap image file)
:   a raster graphics image file format used to store bitmap digital images, independently of the display device.

bounding box
:   the smallest enclosing box for a set of points.

[byte](https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#byte)
:   a unit of digital information that typically consists of eight binary digits, or bits.

colorimetrics
:   the processing and analysis of objects based on their colour.

compression
:   a class of data encoding methods that aims to reduce the size of a file while retaining some or all of the information it contains.

channel
:   a set of pixel intensities within an image that were measured in the same way e.g. at a given wavelength.

crop
:   the removal of unwanted outer areas from an image.

colour histogram
:   a representation of the number of pixels that have colours in each of a fixed list of colour ranges.

edge detection
:   a variety of methods that attempt to automatically identify the boundaries of objects within an image.

fixed-level thresholding
:   thresholding that uses a single, constant cut-off value for every pixel in the image.

grayscale
:   an image in which the value of each pixel is a single value representing only the amount of light (or intensity) of that pixel.

[histogram](https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#histogram)
:   a graphical representation of the distribution of a set of numeric data, usually a vertical bar graph.

image segmentation
:   the process of dividing an image into multiple sections, to be processed or analysed independently.

intensity
:   the value measured at a given pixel in the image.

JPEG
:   a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography

kernel
:   a matrix, usually relatively small, defining a neighbourhood of pixel intensities that will be considered during blurring, edge detection, and other operations.

left-hand coordinate system
:   a system of coordinates where the origin is at the top-left extreme of the image, and coordinates increase as you move down the y axis.

lossy compression
:   a class of data compression methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content.

lossless compression
:   a class of data compression methods that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.

maize
:   a common crop plant grown in many regions of the world. Also known as corn.

mask
:   a binary matrix, usually of the same dimensions as the target image, representing which pixels should be included and excluded in further processing and analysis.

morphometrics
:   the processing and analysis of objects based on their size and shape.

noise
:   random variation of brightness or colour information in images. An undesirable by-product of image capture that obscures the desired information.

pixel
:   the individual units of intensity that make up an image.

[raster graphics](https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#raster_image)
:   images stored as a matrix of pixels.

RGB colour model
:   an additive colour model describing colour in a image with a combination of pixel intensities in three channels: red, green, and blue.

thresholding
:   the process of creating a binary version of a grayscale image, based on whether pixel values fall above or below a given limit or cut-off value.

TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
:   a computer file format for storing raster graphics images; also
abbreviated TIF

titration
:  a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis to determine the concentration of an identified analyte (a substance to be analyzed)

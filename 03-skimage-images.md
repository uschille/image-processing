::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We have covered much of how images are represented in computer software. In this episode we will learn some more methods
for accessing and changing digital images.

## First, import the packages needed for this episode

```python
import imageio.v3 as iio
import ipympl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import skimage as ski
```

## Reading, displaying, and saving images

Imageio provides intuitive functions for reading and writing (saving) images.
All of the popular image formats, such as BMP, PNG, JPEG, and TIFF are supported,
along with several more esoteric formats. Check the
[Supported Formats docs](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/formats/index.html)
for a list of all formats.
Matplotlib provides a large collection of plotting utilities.

Let us examine a simple Python program to load, display,
and save an image to a different format.
Here are the first few lines:

```python
"""Python program to open, display, and save an image."""
# read image
chair = iio.imread(uri="data/chair.jpg")
```

We use the `iio.imread()` function to read a JPEG image entitled **chair.jpg**.
Imageio reads the image, converts it from JPEG into a NumPy array,
and returns the array; we save the array in a variable named `chair`.

Next, we will do something with the image:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(chair)
```

Once we have the image in the program,
we first call `plt.subplots()` so that we will have
a fresh figure with a set of axis independent from our previous calls.
Next we call `plt.imshow()` in order to display the image.

Now, we will save the image in another format:

```python
# save a new version in .tif format
iio.imwrite(uri="data/chair.tif", image=chair)
```

The final statement in the program, `iio.imwrite(uri="data/chair.tif", image=chair)`,
writes the image to a file named `chair.tif` in the `data/` directory.
The `imwrite()` function automatically determines the type of the file,
based on the file extension we provide.
In this case, the `.tif` extension causes the image to be saved as a TIFF.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Metadata, revisited

Remember, as mentioned in the previous section, *images saved with `imwrite()`
will not retain all metadata associated with the original image
that was loaded into Python!*
If the image metadata is important to you, be sure to **always keep an unchanged
copy of the original image!**

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Extensions do not always dictate file type

The `iio.imwrite()` function automatically uses the file type we specify in
the file name parameter's extension.
Note that this is not always the case.
For example, if we are editing a document in Microsoft Word,
and we save the document as `paper.pdf` instead of `paper.docx`,
the file *is not* saved as a PDF document.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Named versus positional arguments

When we call functions in Python,
there are two ways we can specify the necessary arguments.
We can specify the arguments *positionally*, i.e.,
in the order the parameters appear in the function definition,
or we can use *named arguments*.

For example, the `iio.imwrite()`
[function definition](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_autosummary/imageio.v3.imwrite.html)
specifies two parameters,
the resource to save the image to (e.g., a file name, an http address) and
the image to write to disk.
So, we could save the chair image in the sample code above
using positional arguments like this:

`iio.imwrite("data/chair.tif", image)`

Since the function expects the first argument to be the file name,
there is no confusion about what `"data/chair.jpg"` means. The same goes
for the second argument.

The style we will use in this workshop is to name each argument, like this:

`iio.imwrite(uri="data/chair.tif", image=image)`

This style will make it easier for you to learn how to use the variety of
functions we will cover in this workshop.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Resizing an image (10 min)

Using the `chair.jpg` image located in the data folder,
write a Python script to read your image into a variable named `chair`.
Then, resize the image to 10 percent of its current size using these lines of code:

```python
new_shape = (chair.shape[0] // 10, chair.shape[1] // 10, chair.shape[2])
resized_chair = ski.transform.resize(image=chair, output_shape=new_shape)
resized_chair = ski.util.img_as_ubyte(resized_chair)
```

As it is used here,
the parameters to the `ski.transform.resize()` function are
the image to transform, `chair`,
the dimensions we want the new image to have, `new_shape`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

Note that the pixel values in the new image are an approximation of
the original values and should not be confused with actual, observed
data. This is because scikit-image interpolates the pixel values when
reducing or increasing the size of an
image. `ski.transform.resize` has a number of optional
parameters that allow the user to control this interpolation. You
can find more details in the [scikit-image
documentation](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.transform.html#skimage.transform.resize).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Image files on disk are normally stored as whole numbers for space efficiency,
but transformations and other math operations often result in
conversion to floating point numbers.
Using the `ski.util.img_as_ubyte()` method converts it back to whole numbers
before we save it back to disk.
If we don't convert it before saving,
`iio.imwrite()` may not recognise it as image data.

Next, write the resized image out to a new file named `resized.jpg`
in your data directory.
Finally, use `plt.imshow()` with each of your image variables to display
both images in your notebook.
Don't forget to use `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` so you don't overwrite
the first image with the second.
Images may appear the same size in jupyter,
but you can see the size difference by comparing the scales for each.
You can also see the difference in file storage size on disk by
hovering your mouse cursor over the original
and the new files in the Jupyter file browser, using `ls -l` in your shell 
(`dir` with Windows PowerShell), or viewing file sizes in the OS file browser if it is configured so.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Here is what your Python script might look like.

```python
"""Python script to read an image, resize it, and save it under a different name."""

# read in image
chair = iio.imread(uri="data/chair.jpg")

# resize the image
new_shape = (chair.shape[0] // 10, chair.shape[1] // 10, chair.shape[2])
resized_chair = ski.transform.resize(image=chair, output_shape=new_shape)
resized_chair = ski.util.img_as_ubyte(resized_chair)

# write out image
iio.imwrite(uri="data/resized_chair.jpg", image=resized_chair)

# display images
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(chair)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(resized_chair)
```

The script resizes the `data/chair.jpg` image by a factor of 10 in both dimensions,
saves the result to the `data/resized_chair.jpg` file,
and displays original and resized for comparision.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Manipulating pixels

In [the *Image Basics* episode](02-image-basics.md),
we individually manipulated the colours of pixels by changing the numbers stored
in the image's NumPy array. Let's apply the principles learned there
along with some new principles to a real world example.

Suppose we are interested in this maize root cluster image.
We want to be able to focus our program's attention on the roots themselves,
while ignoring the black background.

![](data/maize-root-cluster.jpg){alt='Root cluster image'}

Since the image is stored as an array of numbers,
we can simply look through the array for pixel colour values that are
less than some threshold value.
This process is called *thresholding*,
and we will see more powerful methods to perform the thresholding task in
[the *Thresholding* episode](07-thresholding.md).
Here, though, we will look at a simple and elegant NumPy method for thresholding.
Let us develop a program that keeps only the pixel colour values in an image
that have value greater than or equal to 128.
This will keep the pixels that are brighter than half of "full brightness",
i.e., pixels that do not belong to the black background.

We will start by reading the image and displaying it.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Loading images with imageio: Read-only arrays

When loading an image with imageio, in certain situations the image is stored in a read-only array. If you attempt to manipulate the pixels in a read-only array, you will receive an error message `ValueError: assignment destination is read-only`. In order to make the image array writeable, we can create a copy with `image = np.array(image)` before manipulating the pixel values.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```python
"""Python script to ignore low intensity pixels in an image."""

# read input image
maize_roots = iio.imread(uri="data/maize-root-cluster.jpg")
maize_roots = np.array(maize_roots)

# display original image
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(maize_roots)
```

Now we can threshold the image and display the result.

```python
# keep only high-intensity pixels
maize_roots[maize_roots < 128] = 0

# display modified image
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(maize_roots)
```

The NumPy command to ignore all low-intensity pixels is `roots[roots < 128] = 0`.
Every pixel colour value in the whole 3-dimensional array with a value less
that 128 is set to zero.
In this case,
the result is an image in which the extraneous background detail has been removed.

![](fig/maize-root-cluster-threshold.jpg){alt='Thresholded root image'}

## Converting colour images to grayscale

It is often easier to work with grayscale images, which have a single channel,
instead of colour images, which have three channels.
scikit-image offers the function `ski.color.rgb2gray()` to achieve this.
This function adds up the three colour channels in a way that matches
human colour perception,
see [the scikit-image documentation for details](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.color.html#skimage.color.rgb2gray).
It returns a grayscale image with floating point values in the range from 0 to 1.
We can use the function `ski.util.img_as_ubyte()` in order to convert it back to the
original data type and the data range back 0 to 255.
Note that it is often better to use image values represented by floating point values,
because using floating point numbers is numerically more stable.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Colour and `color`

The Carpentries generally prefers UK English spelling,
which is why we use "colour" in the explanatory text of this lesson.
However, scikit-image contains many modules and functions that include
the US English spelling, `color`.
The exact spelling matters here,
e.g. you will encounter an error if you try to run `ski.colour.rgb2gray()`.
To account for this, we will use the US English spelling, `color`,
in example Python code throughout the lesson.
You will encounter a similar approach with "centre" and `center`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```python
"""Python script to load a color image as grayscale."""

# read input image
chair = iio.imread(uri="data/chair.jpg")

# display original image
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(chair)

# convert to grayscale and display
gray_chair = ski.color.rgb2gray(chair)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(gray_chair, cmap="gray")
```

We can also load colour images as grayscale directly by
passing the argument `mode="L"` to `iio.imread()`.

```python
"""Python script to load a color image as grayscale."""

# read input image, based on filename parameter
gray_chair = iio.imread(uri="data/chair.jpg", mode="L")

# display grayscale image
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(gray_chair, cmap="gray")
```

The first argument to `iio.imread()` is the filename of the image.
The second argument `mode="L"` determines the type and range of the pixel values in the image (e.g., an 8-bit pixel has a range of 0-255). This argument is forwarded to the `pillow` backend, a Python imaging library for which mode "L" means 8-bit pixels and single-channel (i.e., grayscale). The backend used by `iio.imread()` may be specified as an optional argument: to use `pillow`, you would
pass `plugin="pillow"`. If the backend is not specified explicitly, `iio.imread()` determines the backend to use based on the image type.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Loading images with imageio: Pixel type and depth

When loading an image with `mode="L"`, the pixel values are stored as 8-bit integer numbers that can take values in the range 0-255. However, pixel values may also be stored with other types and ranges. For example, some scikit-image functions return the pixel values as floating point numbers in the range 0-1. The type and range of the pixel values are important for the colorscale when plotting, and for masking and thresholding images as we will see later in the lesson. If you are unsure about the type of the pixel values, you can inspect it with `print(image.dtype)`. For the example above, you should find that it is `dtype('uint8')` indicating 8-bit integer numbers.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Keeping only low intensity pixels (10 min)

A little earlier, we showed how we could use Python and scikit-image to turn
on only the high intensity pixels from an image, while turning all the low
intensity pixels off.
Now, you can practice doing the opposite - keeping all
the low intensity pixels while changing the high intensity ones.

The file `data/sudoku.png` is an RGB image of a sudoku puzzle:

![](data/sudoku.png){alt='Su-Do-Ku puzzle'}

Your task is to load the image in grayscale format and turn all of 
the bright pixels in the image to a
light gray colour. In other words, mask the bright pixels that have
a pixel value greater than, say, 192 and set their value to 192 (the
value 192 is chosen here because it corresponds to 75% of the
range 0-255 of an 8-bit pixel). The results should look like this:

![](fig/sudoku-gray.png){alt='Modified Su-Do-Ku puzzle'}

*Hint: the `cmap`, `vmin`, and `vmax` parameters of `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`
will be needed to display the modified image as desired. See the [Matplotlib
documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html) 
for more details on `cmap`, `vmin`, and `vmax`.*

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

First, load the image file `data/sudoku.png` as a grayscale image. 
Note we may want to create a copy of the image array to avoid modifying our original variable and 
also because `imageio.v3.imread` sometimes returns a non-writeable image.

```python
sudoku = iio.imread(uri="data/sudoku.png", mode="L")
sudoku_gray_background = np.array(sudoku)
```

Then change all bright pixel values greater than 192 to 192:

```python
sudoku_gray_background[sudoku_gray_background > 192] = 192
```

Finally, display the original and modified images side by side. Note that we have to specify `vmin=0` and `vmax=255` as the range of the colorscale because it would otherwise automatically adjust to the new range 0-192.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=2)
ax[0].imshow(sudoku, cmap="gray", vmin=0, vmax=255)
ax[1].imshow(sudoku_gray_background, cmap="gray", vmin=0, vmax=255)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Plotting single channel images (cmap, vmin, vmax)

Compared to a colour image, a grayscale image contains only a single
intensity value per pixel. When we plot such an image with `plt.imshow`,
Matplotlib uses a colour map, to assign each intensity value a colour.
The default colour map is called "viridis" and maps low values to purple
and high values to yellow. We can instruct Matplotlib to map low values
to black and high values to white instead, by calling `plt.imshow` with
`cmap="gray"`.
[The documentation contains an overview of pre-defined colour maps](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html).

Furthermore, Matplotlib determines the minimum and maximum values of
the colour map dynamically from the image, by default. That means that in
an image where the minimum is 64 and the maximum is 192, those values
will be mapped to black and white respectively (and not dark gray and light
gray as you might expect). If there are defined minimum and maximum vales,
you can specify them via `vmin` and `vmax` to get the desired output.

If you forget about this, it can lead to unexpected results. Try removing
the `vmax` parameter from the sudoku challenge solution and see what happens.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Access via slicing

As noted in the previous lesson scikit-image images are stored as NumPy arrays,
so we can use array slicing to select rectangular areas of an image.
Then, we can save the selection as a new image, change the pixels in the image,
and so on.
It is important to
remember that coordinates are specified in *(ry, cx)* order and that colour values
are specified in *(r, g, b)* order when doing these manipulations.

Consider this image of a whiteboard, and suppose that we want to create a
sub-image with just the portion that says "odd + even = odd," along with the
red box that is drawn around the words.

![](data/board.jpg){alt='Whiteboard image'}

Using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow` 
we can determine the coordinates of the corners of the area we wish to extract
by hovering the mouse near the points of interest and noting the coordinates 
(remember to run `%matplotlib widget` first if you haven't already).
If we do that, we might settle on a rectangular
area with an upper-left coordinate of *(135, 60)*
and a lower-right coordinate of *(480, 150)*,
as shown in this version of the whiteboard picture:

![](fig/board-coordinates.jpg){alt='Whiteboard coordinates'}

Note that the coordinates in the preceding image are specified in *(cx, ry)* order.
Now if our entire whiteboard image is stored as a NumPy array named `image`,
we can create a new image of the selected region with a statement like this:

`clip = image[60:151, 135:481, :]`

Our array slicing specifies the range of y-coordinates or rows first, `60:151`,
and then the range of x-coordinates or columns, `135:481`.
Note we go one beyond the maximum value in each dimension,
so that the entire desired area is selected.
The third part of the slice, `:`,
indicates that we want all three colour channels in our new image.

A script to create the subimage would start by loading the image:

```python
"""Python script demonstrating image modification and creation via NumPy array slicing."""

# load and display original image
board = iio.imread(uri="data/board.jpg")
board = np.array(board)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(board)
```

Then we use array slicing to
create a new image with our selected area and then display the new image.

```python
# extract, display, and save sub-image
clipped_board = board[60:151, 135:481, :]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(clipped_board)
iio.imwrite(uri="data/clipped_board.tif", image=clipped_board)
```

We can also change the values in an image, as shown next.

```python
# replace clipped area with sampled color
color = board[330, 90]
board[60:151, 135:481] = color
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(board)
```

First, we sample a single pixel's colour at a particular location of the
image, saving it in a variable named `color`,
which creates a 1 × 1 × 3 NumPy array with the blue, green, and red colour values
for the pixel located at *(ry = 330, cx = 90)*.
Then, with the `img[60:151, 135:481] = color` command,
we modify the image in the specified area.
From a NumPy perspective,
this changes all the pixel values within that range to array saved in
the `color` variable.
In this case, the command "erases" that area of the whiteboard,
replacing the words with a beige colour,
as shown in the final image produced by the program:

![](fig/board-final.jpg){alt='"Erased" whiteboard'}

## Practicing with slices (10 min - optional, not included in timing)

Using the techniques you just learned, write a script that
creates, displays, and saves a sub-image containing
only the plant and its roots from "data/maize-root-cluster.jpg"

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Here is the completed Python program to select only the plant and roots
in the image.

```python
"""Python script to extract a sub-image containing only the plant and roots in an existing image."""

# load and display original image
maize_roots = iio.imread(uri="data/maize-root-cluster.jpg")
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(maize_roots)

# extract and display sub-image
clipped_maize = maize_roots[0:400, 275:550, :]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(clipped_maize)


# save sub-image
iio.imwrite(uri="data/clipped_maize.jpg", image=clipped_maize)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Images are read from disk with the `iio.imread()` function.
- We create a window that automatically scales the displayed image with Matplotlib and calling `imshow()` on the global figure object.
- Colour images can be transformed to grayscale using `ski.color.rgb2gray()` or, in many cases, be read as grayscale directly by passing the argument `mode="L"` to `iio.imread()`.
- We can resize images with the `ski.transform.resize()` function.
- NumPy array commands, such as `image[image < 128] = 0`, can be used to manipulate the pixels of an image.
- Array slicing can be used to extract sub-images or modify areas of images, e.g., `clip = image[60:150, 135:480, :]`.
- Metadata is not retained when images are loaded as NumPy arrays using `iio.imread()`.
